Analysis and visualizations of pedestrian-vehicle accidents in Richmond, Virginia from 2009–2015, exploring trends by year and time of day.

Description and conclusion:

We examined the visualizations displaying pedestrian-motor-vehicle accident data in Richmond, VA, from 2009 to 2014/2015. We aimed to assess whether pedestrian accidents showed a continuous upward trend from 2009 to 2015 and whether nighttime accidents predominated.
We first observed the bar charts illustrating total pedestrian-motor-vehicle accidents from 2009 through 2014. These charts revealed year-to-year fluctuations rather than an unambiguous, steady rise. While accident counts appeared to peak in 2011 and again in 2014, a notable dip in 2013 indicates that the progression was not strictly upward. Additionally, 2015 data in the bubble charts for daytime and nighttime incidents appeared drastically lower, which we suspect may reflect incomplete reporting rather than an actual decrease in incidents.
Next, we analyzed comparisons between daytime and nighttime pedestrian accidents across the same period. The bar charts suggested that total daytime accidents consistently exceeded total nighttime accidents. Despite expecting increased risk after dark, the data depicted higher aggregate counts during daylight hours. Moreover, the bubble plots by year and time of day typically showed daytime frequencies in the 50–70 range for most years, with nighttime counts usually trailing in the 40–60 range. While there are variations from year to year, nighttime incidents did not surpass daytime totals clearly or sustainably.
Based on our review, we cannot conclude that pedestrian accidents steadily increased from 2009 through 2015. Although we did observe spikes in 2011 and 2014 relative to 2009, the trajectory was neither smooth nor strictly upward. We also noted a substantial drop in 2013 and a potential reporting gap for 2015. Furthermore, the data showed that daytime accidents outnumbered nighttime accidents overall, contradicting the fact that most pedestrian accidents occur after dark. We recommend further scrutiny of reporting practices—especially for 2015—and additional investigations into underlying causes or contextual factors that may have influenced year-to-year variability.
